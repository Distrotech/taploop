There is code taken from other projects please note the code in this
repository may differ from the base verify any issues against the base
code before contacting the authors of such code.

1)Iproute2 netlink library
2)Jenkins hashing algorithm
3)MD5 HMAC from rfc2104.txt
4)Radius password function from freeradius project as in RFC
5)SSL DTLS code
6)Netfilter Queue/Conntrack Libraries

it is recommended that you contact the author of this package prior to
filing a issue with any authors listed bellow.

libnetlink code included from iproute2
--------------------------------------

This project is released under GPL v2

This is a set of utilities for Linux networking.

Information:
    http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/iproute2

Download:
    http://devresources.linuxfoundation.org/dev/iproute2/download

Repository:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git

Iproute2 development is closely tied to Linux kernel networking
development. Most new features require a kernel and a utility component.

Please submit both to the Linux networking mailing list
   <netdev@vger.kernel.org>

The current source is in the git repository:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git

The master branch contains the source corresponding to the current
code in the mainline Linux kernel (ie follows Linus). The net-next
branch is a temporary branch that tracks the code intended for the
next release; it corresponds with networking development branch in
the kernel.

Acknowledgments [MD5 HMAC http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104.txt]

Pau-Chen Cheng, Jeff Kraemer, and Michael Oehler, have provided
useful comments on early drafts, and ran the first interoperability
tests of this specification. Jeff and Pau-Chen kindly provided the
sample code and test vectors that appear in the appendix.  Burt
Kaliski, Bart Preneel, Matt Robshaw, Adi Shamir, and Paul van
Oorschot have provided useful comments and suggestions during the
investigation of the HMAC construction.
