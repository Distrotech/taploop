Iproute2 development is closely tied to Linux kernel networking
development. Most new features require a kernel and a utility component.

Please submit both to the Linux networking mailing list
   <netdev@vger.kernel.org>

The current source is in the git repository:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git

The master branch contains the source corresponding to the current
code in the mainline Linux kernel (ie follows Linus). The net-next
branch is a temporary branch that tracks the code intended for the
next release; it corresponds with networking development branch in
the kernel.
