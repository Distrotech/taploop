rmove list structures use ->next in struct
remove objfree rely on ref counts to free object
objref is now objref / objunref
fix stupid mistake use of = instead of ==
lots of ref/lock mods to use above
add_kernvlan now finds taploop from threads so can be used outside taploop

Fix up a problem where it was locking &threads not threads
ref count is incremented on alloc now to get rid of all the frees
and use counting instead

Remove the last static BFL [Big Fucking Lock]
there is a race condition if you start the first 
thread and it spawns a thread before threads is initialised
this is prevented by starting management thread first.

the socket server that spawns threads on connection is a example 
of a thread that threads.

Add initial support for ref counted objects
this will eliminate calls to free when the 
ref count goes to zero the object is freed.

this will move to its own file ....

Comments for enums for  socket / thread
Add clientsock_client thread this will be the server side of the client connex
 - currently only prints out the socket details for testing
Add clientsock_serv this is the server socket and listen for connex
 - spawns clientsock_client thread
Dummy client con thread that connex and writes to server
 - will be moved to client app

create the listen thread on init then send 3 connex to it
for testing.

Add lock to taploop struct to protect socks when we add vlans
Destroy lock in cleanup
Set running with thread lock held
Break loop unlocked when checking running
Use tlsock used in read/recv to test locking
Dont call cleanup from thread
call cleanup with thread lock held
Test thread after creation this is probably overkill
